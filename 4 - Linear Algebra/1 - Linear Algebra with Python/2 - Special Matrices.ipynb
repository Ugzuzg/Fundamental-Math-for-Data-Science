    "# Special Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having built-in support for many linear algebra-related operations, Let’s see how NumPy can create special matrices, such as the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "An identity matrix can be constructed using the `np.eye()` functions, which takes an integer argument that determines the *n x n* size of the square identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 4x4 identity matrix\n",
    "identity = np.eye(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the output terminal, `identity` renders as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1. 0. 0. 0.]\n",
    " [0. 1. 0. 0.]\n",
    " [0. 0. 1. 0.]\n",
    " [0. 0. 0. 1.]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix or vector of all zeros can be constructed using the `np.zeros()` function, which takes in a tuple argument for the shape of the NumPy array filled with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 5-element vector of zeros\n",
    "zero_vector = np.zeros((5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output in the terminal as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 3x2 matrix of zeros\n",
    "zero_matrix = np.zeros((3,2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output in the terminal as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[0. 0.]\n",
    " [0. 0.]\n",
    " [0. 0.]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The transpose of a matrix can be accessed using the `.T` attribute of a NumPy array as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\n",
    "A_transpose = A.T\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we print A and A_transpose out in the terminal, A outputs as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 2]\n",
    " [3 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While `A_transpose` outputs as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 3]\n",
    " [2 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `A_transpose` is the transpose of `A`, the rows and columns are swapped.\n"
