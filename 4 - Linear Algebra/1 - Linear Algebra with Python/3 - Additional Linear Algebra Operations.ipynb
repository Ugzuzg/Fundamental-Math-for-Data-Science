    "# Additional Linear Algebra Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving past special matrices, there are some more advanced linear algebra operations we can perform using NumPy. To start, we will be using the `numpy.linalg` sublibrary to perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The “norm” (or length/magnitude) of a vector can be found using `np.linalg.norm()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v = np.array([2,-4,1])\n",
    "v_norm = np.linalg.norm(v)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This outputs `v_norm` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "4.58257569495584\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of a square matrix, if one exists, can be found using `np.linalg.inv()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\n",
    "print(np.linalg.inv(A))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[-2.   1. ]\n",
    " [ 1.5 -0.5]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can actually solve for unknown variables in a system on linear equations in Ax=b form using `np.linalg.solve()`, which takes in the A and b parameters. Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " x + 4y -  z = -1\n",
    "-x - 3y + 2z =  2\n",
    "2x -  y - 2z = -2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We convert to Ax=b form and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# each array in A is an equation from the above system of equations\n",
    "A = np.array([[1,4,-1],[-1,-3,2],[2,-1,-2]])\n",

    "# solve for x, y, and z\n",
    "x,y,z = np.linalg.solve(A,b)\n",

    "1. We have a system of equations written out for us in script.py. Let’s put this in the form Ax=b and solve the system using NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, let’s define A using a NumPy array. Save this NumPy array in a variable called `A`. When you define `A`, pay attention to the coefficients in each equation.\n",

    "    -3x - y + 2z = 0\n",
    "    -x + .5y - 1.5z = -4\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    From this equation, A should look like the following matrix:\n",

    "    [[ 4.   0.   1. ]\n",
    "    [-3.  -1.   2. ]\n",
