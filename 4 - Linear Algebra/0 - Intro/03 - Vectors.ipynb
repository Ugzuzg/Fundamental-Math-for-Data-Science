    "The fundamental building blocks of linear algebra are *vectors*. Vectors are defined as quantities having both direction and magnitude, compared to *scalar* quantities that only have magnitude. In order to have direction and magnitude, vector quantities consist of two or more elements of data. The *dimensionality* of a vector is determined by the number of numerical elements in that vector. For example, a vector with four elements would have a dimensionality of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at examples of a scalar versus a vector. A car driving at a speed of 40mph is a scalar quantity. Describing the car driving 40mph to the east would represent a two-dimensional vector quantity since it has a magnitude in both the *x* and *y* directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can be represented as a series of numbers enclosed in parentheses, angle brackets, or square brackets. In this lesson, we will use square brackets for consistency. For example, a three-dimensional vector is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude (or length) of a vector, *||v||*, can be calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "||v|| = \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} v_{i}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulates translates to the sum of each vector component squared, which can be also written out as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "||v|| = \\sqrt{v_{1}^2 + v_{2}^2 + \\dots + v_{n}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example. We are told that a ball is traveling through the air and given the velocities of that ball in its *x*, *y*, and *z* directions in a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The velocity component values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x = -12\n",
    "- y = 8\n",
    "- z = -2\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the velocities into a vector, and find the total speed of the ball. (Hint: the speed of the ball is the magnitude of the velocity vector!)\n",
