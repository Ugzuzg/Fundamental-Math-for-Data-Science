    "Once we know the sampling distribution of the mean, we can also use it to estimate the probability of observing a particular range of sample means, given some information (either known or assumed) about the population. To do this, we can use the *Cumulative Distribution Function, or (CDF)* of the normal distribution.\n",

    "Let’s work through this with our salmon fish example. Let’s say we are transporting the salmon and want to make sure the crate we carry the fish in will be strong enough to hold the weight.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the CLT, we first estimate that the mean weight of 10 randomly sampled salmon from this population is normally distributed with mean = 60 and standard error = (40^2)/10. Then, we can use this probability distribution to calculate the probability that 10 randomly sampled fish will have a mean weight less than or equal to 75.\n",
