    "Probability is a way to quantify uncertainty. When we flip a fair coin, we say that there is a 50 percent chance (probability = 0.5) of it coming up tails. This means that if we flip INFINITELY many fair coins, half of them will come up tails. Similarly, when we roll a six-sided die, we say there is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a five.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we flip a coin in one hand and roll a die in the other at the same time. What is the probability that the coin comes up tails AND the die comes up as a five? Is there a way to quantify the probability that these two different events BOTH occur? In this lesson, we will walk through different rules of probability that help us quantify the probability of multiple random events."
