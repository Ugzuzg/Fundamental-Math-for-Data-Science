    "\n",
    "1. In **script.py**, there is some code written out for you. First, there is a function, `prob_a_or_b()` which calculates the addition rule. It takes in three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `a`: an event with possible outcomes represented as a set\n",
    "    - `b`: an event with possible outcomes represented as a set\n",
    "    - `all_possible_outcomes`: a set that represents all possible outcomes of a sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "    In `prob_a_or_b()`, the probability of `a` and `b` as well as the probabilty of their intersection has been calculated in the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `prob_a`\n",
    "    - `prob_b`\n",
    "    - `prob_inter`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using these variables, write a return statement that returns the probability of events `a` or `b` occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <details>\n",
    "        <summary>Stuck? Get a hint</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "    You should use the addition rule formula. To do this in python with the three variables, you can do one of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can write out the formula in one return statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    return prob_a + prob_b - prob_inter\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can save the formula as a variable and then return the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    add_rule_formula = prob_a + prob_b - prob_inter\n",
    "    return add_rule_formula\n",
