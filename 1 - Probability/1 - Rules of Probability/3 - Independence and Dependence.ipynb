    "# Independence and Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we flip a fair coin 5 times and get 5 heads in a row. Does this affect the probability of getting heads on the next flip? Even though we may feel like it’s time to see “tails”, it is impossible for a past coin flip to impact a future one. The fact that previous coin flips do not affect future ones is called *independence*. Two events are *independent* if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there cases where previous events DO affect the outcome of the next event? Suppose we have a bag of five marbles: two marbles are blue and three marbles are red. If we take one marble out of the bag, what is the probability that the second marble we take out is blue?\n",

    "\n",
    "This describes two events that are *dependent*. The probability of grabbing a blue marble in the second event *depends* on whether we take out a red or a blue marble in the first event. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we had put back the first marble? Is the probability that we pick a blue marble second independent or dependent on what we pick out first? In this case, the events would be independent.\n",

    "Why do we care if events are independent or dependent? Knowing this helps us quantify the probability of events that depend on preexisting knowledge. This helps researchers understand and predict complex processes such as:\n",
