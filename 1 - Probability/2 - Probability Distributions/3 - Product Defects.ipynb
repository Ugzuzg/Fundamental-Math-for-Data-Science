You’ve been told that the number of defects on a given day follows the Poisson distribution with the rate parameter (lambda) equal to 7. You’re new here, so you want to get a feel for what it means to follow the Poisson(7) distribution. You remember that the Poisson distribution is special because the rate parameter represents the expected value of the distribution, so in this case, the expected value of the Poisson(7) distribution is 7 defects per day.\n",
