    "## Properties of Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The expected value of two independent random variables is the sum of each expected value separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if we wanted to count the total number of heads between 10 fair quarter flips and 6 fair nickel flips, the expected value combined would be 5 heads (from the quarters) and 3 heads (from the nickels) so 8 heads overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiplying a random variable by a constant *a* changes the expected value to be *a* times the expected value of the random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    E(aX) = aE(X)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, the expected number of heads from 10 fair coin flips is 5. If we wanted to calculate the number of heads from this event run 4 times (40 total coin flips), the expected value would now be 4 times the original expected value, or 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adding a constant *a* to the distribution changes the expected value by the value *a*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    E(X + a) = E(X) + a\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let’s say that a test was given and graded, and the average grade was 78 out of 100 points. If the teacher decided to curve the grade by adding 2 points to everyone’s grade, the average would now be 80 points.\n"

    "## Properties of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increasing the values in a distribution by a constant *a* does not change the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    Var(X + a) = Var(X)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is because the variance of a constant is 0 (there is no range for a single number). Adding a constant to a random variable does not add any additional variance. Let’s take the previous example with the teacher curving grades: though the expected value (or average) of the test changes from 78 to 80, the spread and dispersion (or variance) of the test scores stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scaling the values of a random variable by a constant *a* scales the variance by the constant squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    Var(aX) = a^2Var(X)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if we wanted to calculate the number of heads from 10 fair coin flips run 4 times (40 total coin flips), the variance would be multiplied 4<sup>2</sup> times the original variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The variance of the sum of two random variables is the sum of the individual variances:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var (Y)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This principle ONLY holds if the X and Y are independent random variables. Let’s say that X is the event getting a heads on a single fair coin flip, and Y is the event rolling a 2 on a fair six-sided die:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
