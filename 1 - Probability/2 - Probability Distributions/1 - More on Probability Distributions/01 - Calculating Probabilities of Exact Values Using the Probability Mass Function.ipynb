    "# Calculating Probabilities of Exact Values Using the Probability Mass Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution, so it can be described by a probability mass function and cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `poisson.pmf()` method in the `scipy.stats` library to evaluate the probability of observing a specific number given the parameter (expected value) of a distribution. For example, suppose that we expect it to rain 10 times in the next 30 days. The number of times it rains in the next 30 days is “Poisson distributed” with lambda = 10. We can calculate the probability of exactly 6 times of rain as follows:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",

    "Like previous probability mass functions of discrete random variables, individual probabilities can be summed together to find the probability of observing a value in a range.\n",
