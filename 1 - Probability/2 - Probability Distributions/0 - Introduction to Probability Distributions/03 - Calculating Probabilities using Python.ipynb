    "The `binom.pmf()` method from the `scipy.stats` library can be used to calculate the PMF of the binomial distribution at any value. This method takes 3 values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x`: the value of interest\n",
    "- `n`: the number of trials\n",
    "- `p`: the probability of success\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we flip a fair coin 10 times and count the number of heads. We can use the `binom.pmf()` function to calculate the probability of observing 6 heads as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import necessary library\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    " \n",
    "# st.binom.pmf(x, n, p)\n",
    "print(stats.binom.pmf(6, 10, 0.5))\n",

    "Notice that two of the three values that go into the `stats.binomial.pmf()` method are the parameters that define the binomial distribution: `n` represents the number of trials and `p` represents the probability of success."
