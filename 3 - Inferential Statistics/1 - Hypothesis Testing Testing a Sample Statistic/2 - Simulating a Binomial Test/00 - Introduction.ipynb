    "In this lesson, we will walk through a simulation of a binomial hypothesis test in Python. Binomial tests are useful for comparing the frequency of some outcome in a sample to the expected probability of that outcome. For example, if we expect 90% of ticketed passengers to show up for their flight but only 80 of 100 ticketed passengers actually show up, we could use a binomial test to understand whether 80 is significantly different from 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial tests are similar to one-sample t-tests in that they test a sample statistic against some population-level expectation. The difference is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- binomial tests are used for binary categorical data to compare a sample frequency to an expected population-level probability\n",
    "- one-sample t-tests are used for quantitative data to compare a sample mean to an expected population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, as in many other programming languages used for statistical computing, there are a number of libraries and functions that allow a data scientist to run a hypothesis test in a single line of code. However, a data scientist will be much more likely to spot and fix potential errors and interpret results correctly if they have a conceptual understanding of how these functions work. To that end, this lesson will help you build your own conceptual understanding!\n"
