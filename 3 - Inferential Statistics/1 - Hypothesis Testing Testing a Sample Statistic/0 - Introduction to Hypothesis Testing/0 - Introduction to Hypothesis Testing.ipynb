    "*Hypothesis Testing* is a framework for asking questions about a dataset and answering them with probabilistic statements. There are many different kinds of hypothesis tests that can be used to address different kinds of questions and data. In this article, we’ll walk through a simulation of a one sample t- test in order to build intuition about how many different kinds of hypothesis tests work!\n"

    "The International Baccalaureate Degree Programme (IBDP) is a world-wide educational program. Each year, students in participating schools can take a standardized assessment to earn their degree. Total scores on this assessment range from 1-45. Based on data provided [here](https://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/facts-and-figures/statistical-bulletins/diploma-programme-statistical-bulletin/), the average total score for all students who took this exam in May 2020 was around 29.92. The distribution of scores looks something like this:\n",

    "Imagine a hypothetical online school, Statistics Academy, that offers a 5-week test-preparation program. Suppose that 100 students who took the IBDP assessment in May 2020 were randomly chosen to participate in the first group of this program and that these 100 students earned an average score of 31.16 points on the exam — about 1.24 points higher than the international average! Are these students really outperforming their peers? Or could this difference be attributed to random chance?\n"

    "\n",
    "Before attempting to answer this question, it is useful to reframe it in a way that is testable. Right now, our question (“Are the Statistics Academy students really outperforming their peers?”) is not clearly defined. Objectively, this group of 100 students performed better than the general population — but answering “yes, they outperformed their peers!” doesn’t feel particularly satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason it’s not satisfying is this: if we randomly choose ANY group of 100 students from the population of all test takers and calculate the average score for that sample, there’s a 50% chance it will be higher than the population average. Observing a higher average for a single sample is not surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, large differences from the population average are less probable — if all the Statistics Academy students earned 45 points on the exam (the highest possible score), we’d probably be convinced that these students had a real advantage. The trick is to quantify when differences are “large enough” to convince us that these students are systematically different from the general population. We can do this by reframing our question to focus on population(s), rather than our specific sample(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test begins with two competing hypotheses about the population that a particular sample comes from — in this case, the 100 Statistics Academy students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis 1 (technically called the *Null Hypothesis*): The 100 Statistics Academy students are a random sample from the general population of test takers, who had an average score of 29.92. If this hypothesis is true, the Statistics Academy students earned a slightly higher average score by random chance. Visually, this set-up looks something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis 2 (technically called the *Alternative Hypothesis*): The 100 Statistics Academy students came from a population with an average score that is different from 29.92. In this hypothesis, we need to imagine two different populations that don’t actually exist: one where all students took the Statistics Academy test-prep program and one where none of the students took the program. If the alternative hypothesis is true, our sample of 100 Statistics Academy students came from a different population than the other test-takers. This can be visualized as follows:\n",

    "    <img src=\"../../assets/Statistics_HypothesisTestingDiagram_1.svg\" alt=\"alternative hypothesis\" height=\"500px\" />\n",

    "There’s one more clarification we need to make in order to fully specify the alternative hypothesis. Notice that, so far, we have not said anything about the average score for “population 1” in the diagram above, other than that it is NOT 29.92. We actually have three choices for what the alternative hypothesis says about this population average:\n",

In the first version of the hypothesis test (option 1), we estimated the probability of observing a sample average that is at least 1.32 points higher than the population average. For the alternative hypothesis described in option 2, we’re interested in the probability of observing a sample average that is at least 1.32 points DIFFERENT (higher OR lower) than the population average. Visually, this is the proportion of the null distribution that is at least 1.32 units away from the population average (shaded in red below).

At that point, they won’t know whether their sample of students will have an average score that is higher or lower than the population average — although they probably hope that it is higher.\n"

In other words, the observed data is unlikely if the null hypothesis is true. Note that we have directly tested the null hypothesis, but not the alternative hypothesis! We therefore need to be a little careful about how we interpret this test: we cannot say that we’ve proved that the alternative hypothesis is the truth — only that the data we collected would be unlikely under null hypothesis, and therefore we believe that the alternative hypothesis is more consistent with our observations.\n"

    "\n",
    "While it is perfectly reasonable to report a p-value, many data scientists use a predetermined threshold to decide whether a particular p-value is significant or not. P-values below the chosen threshold are declared significant and lead the data scientist to “reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative”. A common choice for this threshold, which is also sometimes referred to as Alpha, is 0.05 — but this is an arbitrary choice! Using a lower threshold means you are less likely to find significant results, but also less likely to mistakenly report a significant result when there is none.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Impact of the Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that different alternative hypotheses can lead to different conclusions. For example, the one-sided test described above (p = 0.031) would lead a data scientist to reject the null at a 0.05 significance level. Meanwhile, a two-sided test on the same data leads to a p-value of 0.062, which is greater than the 0.05 threshold. Thus, for the two-sided test, a data scientist could not reject the null hypothesis. This highlights the importance of choosing an alternative hypothesis ahead of time!\n"

    "- A small p-value means that an observed sample statistic (or something more extreme) would be unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
