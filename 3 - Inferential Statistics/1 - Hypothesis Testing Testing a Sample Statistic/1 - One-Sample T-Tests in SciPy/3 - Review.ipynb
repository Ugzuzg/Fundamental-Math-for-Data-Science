    "Congratulations! You now know how to implement a one-sample t-test in Python and verify the assumptions of the test. To recap, here are some of the things you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-sample t-tests are used for comparing a sample mean to an expected population mean\n",
    "- A one-sample t-test can be implemented in Python using the SciPy `ttest_1samp()` function\n",
    "- Assumptions of a one-sample t-test include:\n",
    "    - The sample was randomly drawn from the population of interest\n",
    "    - The observations in the sample are independent\n",
    "    - The sample size is large “enough” or the sample data is normally distributed\n"

    "As a final exercise, some data has been loaded for you with purchase prices for consecutive days at BuyPie. You can access the first day using `daily_prices[0]`, the second using `daily_prices[1]`, etc.. To practice running a one-sample t-test and inspecting the resulting p-value, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate and print out a p-value for day 1 where the null hypothesis is that the average purchase price was 1000 Rupees and the alternative hypothesis is that the average purchase price was **not** 1000 Rupees. Print out the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the same hypothesis tests for days 1-10 (the fastest way to do this is with a for-loop!) and print out the resulting p-values. What’s the smallest p-value you observe for those 10 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try changing the null hypothesis so that the expected population mean that you’re testing against is **different** from 1000. Try any numbers that you want. How do your p-values change?"
