    "1. Suppose that the average score on a standardized test is 50 points. A researcher wants to know whether students who take this test in an ergonomically designed chair score significantly differently from the general population of test-takers. The researcher randomly assigns 100 students to take the test in an ergonomic chair. Then, the researcher runs a hypothesis test with a significance threshold of 0.05 and the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
