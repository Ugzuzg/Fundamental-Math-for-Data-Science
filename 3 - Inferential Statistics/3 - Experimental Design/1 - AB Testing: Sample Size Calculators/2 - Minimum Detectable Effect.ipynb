    "In order to detect precise differences, we need a very large sample size. In order to choose a sample size, we need to know the smallest difference that we actually care to measure. This “smallest difference” is our desired *minimum detectable effect*. This is also sometimes referred to as *desired lift*.\n",

    "Minimum detectable effect or lift is generally expressed as a percent of the baseline conversion rate. Suppose that 6% of customers currently subscribe to our website (that’s our baseline conversion rate). Changing a website layout is hard, so we only think that it’s worth doing if at least 8% of our customers would subscribe with the new layout. To calculate this as a percentage of our baseline:\n",
