    "# Simulating Data for a Chi-Square test\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last exercise, we used some data from an A/B test to run a Chi-Square test. In the next few exercises, we’ll build up a simulation to understand the considerations that go into choosing a sample size for that test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again consider the A/B test example from the previous exercise, comparing email subjects with and without the recipient’s first name. Suppose we know that visitors have a 50% chance of opening the control email and a 65% chance of opening the name email (30% lift!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use **lift** to refer to the inherent difference in the distributions of our two groups of data. In the *A/B Testing: Sample Size Calculators* lesson, we learned that **minimum detectable effect** is the smallest size of the difference between the two groups that we want our test to be able to detect. If we set up our experiment with a minimum detectable effect of at least 20%, our statistical test should detect a difference with a “lift” or “effect” of 20% or greater. In this lesson we are going to simulate data that has a lift of 30% to demonstrate how the inherent lift impacts the power of our statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the aforementioned probabilities to simulate a dataset of 100 email recipients as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample_control = np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], size=50, p=[.5, .5])\n",
    "sample_name = np.random.choice(['yes', 'no'], size=50, p=[.65, .35])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us two simulated samples, of 50 recipients each, who hypothetically saw the name or control email subject. Each one looks something like `['yes' 'no' 'no' 'no' 'yes' 'yes' ...]`, where `'yes'` corresponds to an opened email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can assemble these arrays into a data frame that looks a lot like the one we saw in exercise 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "group = ['control']*50 + ['name']*50\n",
    "outcome = list(sample_control) + list(sample_name)\n",
    "sim_data = {\"Email\": group, \"Opened\": outcome}\n",
    "sim_data = pd.DataFrame(sim_data)\n",
    "print(sim_data.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email | Opened |\n",
    "| -- | -- |\n",
    "| control | no |\n",
    "| control | yes |\n",
    "| control | yes |\n",
    "| control | no |\n",
    "| control | no |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how we created this data frame, all of the “control” observations will be listed first, followed by all of the “name” observations.\n"

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In script.py, you’ll see the code from the narrative, which can be used to simulate a dataset for a Chi-Square test. You’ll notice that we’ve replaced all hard-coded numbers with the following variables: `sample_size`, `control_rate`, and `name_rate` (which is calculated using `control_rate` and `lift`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Change the sample size to 4 and press “Run”. Inspect the output. Does it look as expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "    <details>\n",
    "        <summary>Stuck? Get a hint</summary>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The dataset ab_data should have 4 rows with 2 controls & names in the `Email` column and randomized yes or nos in the `Opened` column.\n",
    "    </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Press “Run” a few more times and notice how the data changes each time even though you haven’t changed the code. This happens because we’ve provided probabilities for the outcomes; (opened or not), rather than specific values.\n"
