    "# Baseline Conversion Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B tests usually compare an option that we’re currently using to a new option that we suspect might be better. In order to compare the two options, we need a metric. Often, our metric will be the percent of users who take a certain action after interacting with one of our options. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The percent of customers who **buy a t-shirt** after visiting one of two versions of a website\n",
    "- The percent of users who **click** on one of two versions of an ad\n",
    "\n",
    "In the t-shirt example above, the *baseline conversion rate* is our estimate for the percent of people who will buy a shirt under the current website design.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generally calculate a baseline by looking at historical data for the option that we’re currently using. For example, suppose that 2000 people visited a website over the past three months and 320 of those visitors purchased a shirt. We could estimate the baseline rate as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "baseline = 320/2000*100\n",
    "print(baseline) #output: 16.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This number may be written as a proportion (eg., 0.16) or a percent (eg., 16%).\n"
