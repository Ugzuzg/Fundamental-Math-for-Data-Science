    "# Implementing a One-Sample T-Test\n",

    "In the last exercise, we inspected a sample of 50 purchase prices at BuyPie and saw that the average was 980 Rupees. Suppose that we want to run a one-sample t-test with the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null: The average cost of a BuyPie order is 1000 Rupees\n",
    "- Alternative: The average cost of a BuyPie order is **not** 1000 Rupees.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy has a function called `ttest_1samp()`, which performs a one-sample t-test for you. `ttest_1samp()` requires two inputs, a sample distribution (eg. the list of the 50 observed purchase prices) and a mean to test against (eg. `1000`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tstat, pval = ttest_1samp(sample_distribution, expected_mean)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function uses your sample distribution to determine the sample size and estimate the amount of variation in the population — which are used to estimate the null distribution. It returns two outputs: the t-statistic (which we won’t cover in this course), and the p-value.\n"

    "\n",
    "    Store the p-value in a variable called `pval`. Remember that it is the second output of the `ttest_1samp()` function. We won’t use the first output, the t-statistic, so you can store it in a variable with whatever name you’d like.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Given that the mean purchase price in this sample was 980, which is not very far from 1000, we probably expect this p-value to be relatively large. The only reason it COULD be small (eg., <.05) is if purchase prices had very little variation (eg., they were all within a few Rupees of 980). We can see from the data print out that this is not the case. Therefore, a p-value around 0.49 makes sense!\n",
