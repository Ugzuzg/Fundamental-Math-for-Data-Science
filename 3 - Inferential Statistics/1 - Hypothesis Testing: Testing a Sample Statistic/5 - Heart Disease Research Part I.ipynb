    "    - `yes_hd`, which contains data for patients **with** heart disease\n",
    "    - `no_hd`, which contains data for patients **without** heart disease\n",

    "    For this project, we’ll investigate the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `chol`: serum cholestorol in mg/dl\n",
    "    - `fbs`: An indicator for whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "\n",
    "    To start, we’ll investigate cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease. Use the dataset `yes_hd` to save cholesterol levels for patients with heart disease as a variable named `chol_hd`.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In general, total cholesterol over 240 mg/dl is considered “high” (and therefore unhealthy). Calculate the mean cholesterol level for patients who were diagnosed with heart disease and print it out. Is it higher than 240 mg/dl?\n",

    "    - Null: People with heart disease have an average cholesterol level equal to 240 mg/dl\n",

    "    Note: Unfortunately, the `scipy.stats` function we’ve been using does not (at the time of writing) have an `alternative` parameter to change the alternative hypothesis for this test. Therefore, you’ll have to run a two-sided test. However, since you calculated earlier that the average cholesterol level for heart disease patients is greater than 240 mg/dl, you can calculate the p-value for the one-sided test indicated above simply by dividing the two-sided p-value in half.\n",

    "\n",
    "    When you divide the p-value by two (in order to run the one-sided test), you should get a p-value of `0.0035`. This is less than 0.05, suggesting that heart disease patients have an average cholesterol level significantly higher than 240 mg/dl.\n",

If this sample were representative of the population, approximately how many people would you expect to have diabetes? Calculate and print out this number.\n",
