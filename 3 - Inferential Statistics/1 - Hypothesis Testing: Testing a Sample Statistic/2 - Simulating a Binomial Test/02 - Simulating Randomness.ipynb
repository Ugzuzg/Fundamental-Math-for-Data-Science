    "# Simulating Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last exercise, we calculated that there were 500 site visitors to live-it-LIVE.com this month and 41 of them made a purchase. In comparison, if each of the 500 visitors had a 10% chance of making a purchase, we would expect around 50 of those visitors to buy something. Is 41 different enough from 50 that we should question whether this months’ site visitors really had a 10% chance of making a purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "To conceptualize why our **expectation** (50) and **observation** (41) might not be equal — EVEN IF there was no dip in the purchase probability — let’s turn to a common probability example: flipping a fair coin. We can simulate a coin flip in Python using the `numpy.random.choice()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flip = np.random.choice(['heads', 'tails'], size=1, p=[0.5, 0.5])\n",
    "print(flip) \n",
    "## output is either ['heads'] or ['tails']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run this code (or flip a real coin) a few times, we’ll find that — just like we can’t know ahead of time whether any single visitor to Live-it-LIVE.com will make a purchase — we can’t predict the outcome of any individual coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we flip a fair coin 10 times in a row, we expect about 5 of those coins to come up heads (50%). We can simulate this in python by changing the `size` parameter of `numpy.random.choice()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flip = np.random.choice(['heads', 'tails'], size=10, p=[0.5, 0.5])\n",
    "print(flip)\n",
    "## output is something like: ['heads' 'heads' 'heads' 'tails' 'tails' 'heads' 'heads' 'tails' 'heads' 'heads']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try this yourself, it’s perfectly reasonable that you’ll get only four heads, or maybe six or seven! Because this is a random process, we can’t guarantee that exactly half of our coin flips will come up heads. Similarly, even if each Live-it-LIVE visitor has a 10% chance of making a purchase, that doesn’t mean we expect **exactly** 10% to do so in any given sample.\n"

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In script.py, use the `random.choice()` function from NumPy to simulate a single visitor to Live-it-LIVE.com, who has a 10% chance of making a purchase (p=0.1). Save the outcome as a variable named `one_visitor` and print it. If the visitor made a purchase, the value of `one_visitor` should be `['y']`; if they did not make a purchase, it should be `['n']` (just like in the original data!).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Did that one simulated visitor make a purchase? Try pressing “Run” a few more times and see if you ever observe a different outcome. (Note that you’ll see an error for the next checkpoint if you press run a few times; don’t worry about that!).\n",

    "\n",
    "    Fill in the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    one_visitor = np.random.choice(['y', ___], size=1, p=[___, 0.9])\n",
    "    print(one_visitor)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, create a new list named `simulated_monthly_visitors`, which contains the randomly-generated outcomes for 500 visitors to Live-it-LIVE.com (still with a 10% chance of a purchase). Print `simulated_monthly_visitors` out. Do you see any visitors in this list who made a purchase?\n",
