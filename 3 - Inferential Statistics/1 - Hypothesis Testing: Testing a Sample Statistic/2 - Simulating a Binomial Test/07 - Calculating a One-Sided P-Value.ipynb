    "# Calculating a One-Sided P-Value\n",

    "*P-value* calculations and interpretations depend on the *alternative hypothesis* of a test, a description of the difference from expectation that we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s return to the 10-coin-flip example from earlier. Suppose that we flipped a coin 10 times and observed only 2 heads. We might run a hypothesis test with the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null: the probability of heads is 0.5\n",
    "- Alternative: the probability of heads is **less than** 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis test asks the question: IF the probability of heads is 0.5, what’s the probability of observing 2 or fewer heads among a single sample of 10 coin flips?\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we used a for-loop to repeatedly (10000 times!) flip a fair coin 10 times, and store the number of heads (for each set of 10 flips) in a list named `outcomes`. The probability of observing 2 or fewer heads among 10 coin flips is approximately equal to the proportion of those 10000 experiments where we observed 0, 1, or 2 heads:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "outcomes = np.array(outcomes)\n",
    "p_value = np.sum(outcomes <= 2)/len(outcomes) \n",
    "print(p_value) #output: 0.059\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation is equivalent to calculating the proportion of this histogram that is colored in red: \n",
    "\n",
    "![null distribution with bars colored red for values less than or equal to 2](../../assets/one_sided_coin_flip.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimated that the probability of observing 2 or fewer heads is about 0.059 (5.9%). This probability (0.059) is referred to as a one-sided p-value.\n"

    "1. The code you wrote to generate `null_outcomes` is available to you in script.py. Use `null_outcomes` to estimate the p-value for a binomial hypothesis test with the following null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
