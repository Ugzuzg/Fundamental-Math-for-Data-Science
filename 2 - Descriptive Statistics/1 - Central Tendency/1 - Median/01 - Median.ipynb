    "# Median\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition for the median of a dataset is:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The value that, assuming the dataset is ordered from smallest to largest, falls in the middle. If there are an even number of values in a dataset, you either report both of the middle two values or their average.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are always two steps to finding the median of a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Order the values in the dataset from smallest to largest\n",
    "2. Identify the number(s) that fall(s) in the middle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example One: Even Number of Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a dataset with the following ten numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "24,\\ 16,\\ 30,\\ 10,\\ 12,\\ 28,\\ 38,\\ 2,\\ 4,\\ 36\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to order these numbers from smallest to largest:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2,\\ 4,\\ 10,\\ 12,\\ [16,\\ 24],\\ 28,\\ 30,\\ 36,\\ 38\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this dataset has an even number of values, there are two medians: `16` and `24` — `16` has four datapoints to the left, and `24` has four datapoints to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you can report both values as the median, people often average them. If you averaged `16` and `24`, you could report the median as `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Two: Odd Number of Values\n",
    "\n",
    "If we added another value (say, `24`) to the dataset and sorted it, we would have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2,\\ 4,\\ 10,\\ 12,\\ 16,\\ [24],\\ 24,\\ 28,\\ 30,\\ 36,\\ 38\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The new median is equal to `24`, because there are 5 values to the left of it, and 5 values to the right of it."
