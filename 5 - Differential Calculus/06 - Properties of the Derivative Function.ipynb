    "# Properties of the Derivative Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivative functions contain important information. Let’s look at a couple of examples. Going back to our running example, *f(t)* describes a runner’s position as a function of time; therefore, the derivative function *f’(t)* describes the runner’s speed at any time *t*. Let’s say we have a function *s(t)* that describes the real-time sales of a particular product; the corresponding derivative function *s’(t)* describes how those sales are changing in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the general information we can get as well. If *f’(x)* > 0, the corresponding function *f(x)* is increasing. Keep in mind that *f(x)* itself may be negative even though the derivative *f’(x)* is positive. The derivative says nothing about the value of the original function, only about how it is changing. Similarly, if *f’(x)* < 0, then the original function is decreasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *f’(x)* = 0, then the function is not changing. This can mean one of a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It may mean that the function has reached a *local maximum* (or maxima). A local maximum is a value of x where *f’(x)* changes from positive to negative and thus hits 0 along the way. In *f(x)*, the local maximum is higher than all the points around it.\n",
    "- It may also mean that the function has reached what is called a *local minimum*. A local minimum is lower than the points around it. When *f’(x)* goes from negative values to 0 to positive values, a local minimum forms.\n",
    "- It may be an *inflection poin*t. This is a point where a function has a change in the direction of curvature. For example, the curve of the function goes from “facing down” to “facing up.” Finding inflection points involves a second derivative test, which we will not get to in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Global maxima* and *global minima* are the largest or smallest over the entire range of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning models, maxima and minima are key concepts as they’re usually what we are trying to find when we optimize!\n"
