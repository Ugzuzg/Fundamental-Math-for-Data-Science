    "# More on Calculating Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "So we now have an idea on where to start differentiating (that is, take the derivative of) things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4\\log(x) \\\\ x^2 + \\log(x) \\\\ x^2\\log(x) \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final step is to understand how to differentiate specific items themselves, like *log(x)* and *x^2*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start off with how to differentiate *polynomials*. As a reminder, these are expressions that include the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- addition\n",
    "- subtraction\n",
    "- multiplication\n",
    "- nonnegative exponents\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "3x^4-2x^2+4\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To differentiate polynomials, we use the *power rule*. This states the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dx}x^{n} = nx^{n-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To take the derivative of *3x^4*, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dx}3x^{4} = 4*3x^{4-1}=12x^{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s try a challenging problem. Find the derivative of the following polynomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4x^5+2x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: use a concept we learned in the previous exercise. Check your solution below.\n",

    "    <summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/derivative-solution-1.png)\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are rules even beyond the power rule. Many common functions have defined derivatives. Here are some common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dx}ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x \\\\ \\frac{d}{dx}sin(x) = cos(x) \\\\ \\frac{d}{dx}cos(x) = -sin(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use these rules to try out some practice problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice Problem 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2x+ln(x)+cos(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/deriv-2.png)\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice Problem 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2x*ln(x)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "    <summary>Solution</summary>\n",

    "![](./assets/derivative-sol-3.png)\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking derivatives is something that takes plenty of practice to get the hang of. As a learner in this course, your biggest takeaway should be that we can differentiate many common functions by using some combination of these rules in tandem.\n"
